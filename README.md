DocuCanvas
====================

### or How I Learned to Use Canvas and Make Wireframes Fun!

Creating documentation and wireframes for things can be tedious, and hard, and plain not fun. To remedy the situation there's DocuCanvas!

Main Features:
* Add comment/notes/descriptions/etc over an image
* Break up section of a project to show what things should look like
* Simulate wireframing techniques via web portal
* Take advantage of HTM5 Canvas elements for all of it

Planned features:
* Upload of multiple images
* Compositing via pallets
* Automated creation of multi layered PNGs
* PDF Export

Basically instead of a bunch of disperate documents, text files, Photoshop files, mind maps, and a million other things that get lost and hard to document a team could consolidate, create, and consume their project documentation in the same spot.
